# Deferred-Work Sweep Triage

**Goal:** Classify every selected open entry in `{implementation_artifacts}/deferred-work.md`
into a machine-readable triage plan the orchestrator can validate and execute.

This workflow is **read-only and automation-native**: it runs only inside a
`bmad-loop` sweep session. You never edit the ledger, never edit code, never
ask questions. Your sole output is the result file. (The one exception is
migration mode, which edits exactly one file — the ledger.)

## On Activation

### Step 0: Automation Check & Mode Dispatch

Run: `echo "${BMAD_LOOP_MODE:-}"`

If the output is not `1`, state that this skill only runs inside a bmad-loop
sweep and end your turn. Otherwise read `./automation-mode.md` fully — its
rules and result schema govern this entire run.

If the invocation carries `--migrate <manifest-path>`, this is a **migration
session**, not triage: read `./migration-mode.md` and follow it instead of
Steps 1–4 below.

### Step 1: Locate the ledger

Read `{project-root}/_bmad/bmm/config.yaml` to resolve `implementation_artifacts`,
then read `{implementation_artifacts}/deferred-work.md` in full. Open entries
are `### DW-<n>:` blocks whose `status:` line is `open`. If the ledger is
missing or unreadable, escalate `CRITICAL` (`type: missing-ledger`) per
automation-mode.md and end your turn.

An entry carrying an `archived:` line keeps only a stub here — its full body
lives in the sibling `deferred-work-archive.md`, keyed by the same DW- id; read
it there before classifying that entry. An `archived-body:` line says the same
of an entry that was archived and later reopened: it is live work again, but the
body it carried before that close is still in the archive file, in the block
stamped with the date the line carries.

If the invocation carries `--only DW-1,DW-2,...`, those ids are the complete
triage universe for this session. Read the full ledger, but verify and partition
exactly those named open entries; do not add other raw-open entries to
`open_ids` or any result category. The orchestrator has already applied the
operator's named-subset or severity-floor selector and validates your result
against this exact scope.

If the invocation carries `--feedback <path>`, read that file FIRST — it lists
the deterministic validation errors your previous attempt's result.json failed
on. Fix exactly those defects in this attempt's output.

### Step 2: Verify every selected entry against the code

Ledger statuses are known-unreliable: entries are often resolved by later work
but never marked done. For EACH entry in the triage universe:

1. Read its `location:` (file/component) in the current tree.
2. Check whether the described issue still exists — read the code, grep for
   the symptom, check `git log` for commits that touched the area since the
   entry's `origin:` date.
3. Record concrete evidence either way. "Probably fixed" is not evidence;
   a file:line or commit hash is.

Use sub-agents for parallel verification when available; never ask permission.

### Step 3: Partition

Classify each entry in the triage universe into exactly ONE category:

- **already_resolved** — the issue no longer exists in the code. Requires
  concrete `evidence` (file:line that now handles it, or the commit that fixed
  it). The orchestrator closes the ledger entry deterministically.
- **bundles** — buildable now: every file the fix needs already exists and no
  future story has to land first. Group entries that share a touchpoint (same
  file, same subsystem, same validator pattern) into cohesive single-goal
  bundles sized for one dev session; an entry that stands alone is a
  one-entry bundle. `name` matches `^[a-z0-9][a-z0-9-]{1,39}\Z` (kebab-case,
  at most 40 characters; e.g. `unicode-string-hardening`), and `intent` is
  2–6 sentences describing the one cohesive goal.
- **blocked** — the fix is only meaningful (or meaningfully easier) after a
  named future story/epic lands. Name the blocker verbatim.
- **skip** — superseded, moot, or tied to a scenario the project explicitly
  excludes. Give the reason.
- **decisions** — a human must choose. ALWAYS a decision, never a bundle:
  renegotiating anything inside a spec's `<frozen-after-approval>` block,
  reversing a deliberate human-approved scope decision, API-shape changes that
  ripple to unbuilt consumers, and entries deferred with reason
  "auto-mode: needs human decision". Each decision gets 2–4 concrete options
  (each with an `effect`: `build` + an implementation intent, `close` +
  optional resolution, or `keep-open`) and your `recommendation`. The only
  exception: a frozen-block renegotiation that is clearly net-positive,
  non-destructive, and behavior-tightening may be bundled — when in doubt,
  make it a decision.

Every entry in the triage universe appears in exactly one category. The orchestrator validates
this deterministically; a missed or double-counted entry fails the whole
result and burns a retry.

For a bundle whose intended deliverables are confined to ignored content in the
configured `implementation_artifacts` directory strictly inside the code repository,
describe those deliverables and their location in the existing `intent` field.
Do not add a triage receipt field or assert a receipt on the executing session's
behalf. That session may write `Artifact only: true` on its own line beside
`Status:`, with `true` on the same line as the label and no trailing explanation,
in its own last genuine `## Auto Run Result` only when its actual deliverables
qualify, never based on old artifacts alone. The marker must be authored in the
current session, outside fenced blocks and without an orchestrator repair note; frontmatter does
not assert it, and the value must be the strict boolean `true`. The ordinary
proof-of-work probe must first positively find no changes, and the receipt gate
requires a positive ignored-file listing scoped to that directory. All other
verification and ledger-close checks still apply. In an isolated worktree, successful
integration publishes the accepted ignored bundle spec before teardown. Additional
ignored regular files must be named in the accepted spec's `artifact_deliverables`
frontmatter list, using exact paths relative to `implementation_artifacts`. Describe
these intended outputs in the bundle's `intent` so the executing session can declare
them. Directories, globs, absolute paths, traversal, symlinks, and the orchestrator-owned
ledger and sprint board are forbidden; undeclared files are not copied. Publication
checks destination baselines captured before execution. Conflicting main-checkout
changes pause publication and retain source artifacts for recovery. The receipt
alone does not publish files.

### Step 4: Write the result and end your turn

Write the result.json per `./automation-mode.md` and state in one line how
many entries went to each category. End your turn. Do not edit any file other
than the result file.
